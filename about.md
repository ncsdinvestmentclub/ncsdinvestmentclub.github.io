Hello!

The North County San Diego Investment is a group of professionals who like to invest and drink beer.
We hope to meet at local drinking establishments and consume adult beverage(s) while discussing investments and investment strategies.

The members wish to leanr and share their experiences and insight from investing in a casual setting while improving some professional skills such as:
*Presentations
*Programming
*Understanding of the investment world
*Promote taking Exams such as Series 7,65, and others

The group is meant to share ideas. Hopefully you will learn a thing or two!
